## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Approximate Algorithms** (`Yog.Approximate` module) - parachute/exact parity with Elixir approximation algorithms (clique, coloring, vertex cover, TSP, independent set, etc.)
- **New Serialization Formats**:
  - Pajek parser and serializer (`Yog.IO.Pajek`)
  - MatrixMarket parser and serializer (`Yog.IO.MatrixMarket`)
  - Adjacency List/TGF/Edgelist parser and serializer formats (`Yog.IO.List`, `Yog.IO.Tgf`, `Yog.IO.Edgelist`)
  - Full deserialization support & multiple visualizer format outputs (NetworkX, D3Force, Cytoscape, VisJs) in `Yog.IO.Json` module
- **Flow & Optimization**:
  - Dinic's maximum flow algorithm
  - Push-Relabel maximum flow algorithm
- **Pathfinding & Search**:
  - LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) using Binary Lifting
  - Yen's K-Shortest loopless paths
  - Bidirectional search (Dijkstra and BFS)
  - Chinese Postman tour solver
  - Johnson's all-pairs shortest paths for sparse graphs
- **Matching & Centrality**:
  - Hopcroft-Karp, Hungarian, and Edmonds' Blossom matching algorithms
  - HITS centrality (Hubs and Authorities)
- **Advanced Graph Analysis**:
  - Health module (`Yog.Health`) for network structural and quality metrics
  - Highlight formatting utilities for path, MST, min-cut, and matchings in DOT/Mermaid renderers
- **Hedgehog Property-Based Tests**: Replaced FsCheck with Hedgehog to achieve parity and property test alignment with Elixir `yog_ex`.

### Changed
- Marked Network Simplex as experimental
- Standardized `addEdge` endpoints validation behavior (raises exception instead of auto-creating ghost nodes, unless `addEdgeEnsured` or `addEdgeEnsuredWith` is explicitly used)
- Unified transform, operation, and generator signatures for better Elixir parity

### Fixed
- Fixed GDF schema auto-discovery bug and unified schema output parameters
- Fixed formatting of doc chess grids
