# IriTools
Contains tools for handling IRIs for use with RDF. Only one class/tool at the moment:
## IriReference
This is a C# wrapper around the Uri class to make it work for IRI References. 

The major difference between Uri and IriReference is that the "fragment", the part after the `#` is included in equality treatment. 
This is crucial when using Uris with RDF.
