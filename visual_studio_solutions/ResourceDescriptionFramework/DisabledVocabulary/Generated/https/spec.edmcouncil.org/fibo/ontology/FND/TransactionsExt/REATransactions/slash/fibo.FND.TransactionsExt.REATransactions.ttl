Therefore this identity relationship has a range of Thing, but is modeled as a sub property of \"identity\" to make this conclusion explicit. Editorial Note: This is a relationship with the sense that some relative thing takes the form of something, but is distinct from the similar concept as applied to Asset, in which the thing which takes the form of some asset is owned by someone. Here it is a resource, irrespective of whether or by whom it is owned. Labeled as \"takes material form\" to disambiguate these two relationships."""@en.
