Additional note (IBM): there is a further application of this. When a lender takes a loan which is a where the value of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property, at that point it is required for the lender to also get a private mortgage insurance, so they are paying separately for the mortgage insurance so that if the borrower defaults above 80% then the mortgage insurance pays the loss. In the Loan Party Insurer (new \"Party\" type) you have Loan Party Insured Ratio (e.g. the 80% in the example above). These are different situations but the same principle. So this needs to be modeled for both. 30 June: Is this Lender or Borrower? since you have one lender and one borrower in a single loan, but multiple lenders in the case of packaging this up for a security - there are then multiple lenders and multiple borrowers. A similar kind of insurance exists in the one lender one borrower scenario i.e. the mortgage loan itself. There are two concepts here. the MIG thing was for bundling these. the MIG might apply across multiple contracts, but still be a fact about \"the\" contract? The notes about 80% above (IBM) are about the individual loan. ACTION: Tidy this up."""@en.

When you get into indemnification, then for instance if the product doesn't meet the investor's requirement such that if it doesn't get paid then the lender steps in and takes the hit for the loan - this is usually a precondition for securitizing (issuing) the loan in a pool. If the loan is not going to be sold on the secondary market there would be no need to indemnify that loan so this term would not apply. Indemnification is insurance for the investor, while the lender is the one providing that indemnification."@en.
