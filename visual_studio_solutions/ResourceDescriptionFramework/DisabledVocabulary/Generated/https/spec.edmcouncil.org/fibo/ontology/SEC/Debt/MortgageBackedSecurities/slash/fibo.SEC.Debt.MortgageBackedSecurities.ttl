                                                 """The class Mortgage Pool originally had a property 'pool type' referring to a selection list of textual stylings of pool types. Those are now replaced with actual sub types of mortgage pool. Here are the original notes and definition that went with the enumerated list of pool types: 

The type of pool for a pool backed security. Each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc.

Further Notes:
Non Agency signifies a tranched security, for which there will also be a Tranche Type for the security tranche itself. All other pool types are Agency pool types. 

List Populated from Cutter document Page 5. 

Additional terms from Adept Advistory:
Under Agency mortgages, basically you have various types of pools under the various agencies. You have:
-GNMA-I
-GNMA-II
-GNMA Platinum
-FNMA 
-FHLMC
-FHLMC Gold
As far as definitions:The simple definition is that each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc. Also, GNMA is explicitly backed by the US government, while FNMA and FHLMC are only implicitly backed by the US government. Perhaps there needs to be some research done on the parameters for what makes a loan conforming or not.
