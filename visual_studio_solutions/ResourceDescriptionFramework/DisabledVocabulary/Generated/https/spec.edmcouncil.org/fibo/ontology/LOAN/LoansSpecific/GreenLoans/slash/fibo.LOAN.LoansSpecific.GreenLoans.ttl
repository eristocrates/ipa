It includes: (1) the scope of assessment, (2) the relevant spacial boundaries, (3) the time period(s) over which the assessment is to be conducted, (4) organizational boundaries - which parts of an organization or project are included in the evaluation, (5) impact categories - which environmental or sustainability impacts are included, (6) lifecycle boundaries - which stages of the lifecycle are included, (7) exclusions - specific elements, processes, or impacts that are excluded from the assessment and justification for these exclusions, and (8) stakeholder boundaries - the extent to which external stakeholders or externalities (e.g., indirect social impacts) are considered.
		
		- The scope statement specifies which aspects, activities, processes, or entities are included in the evaluation. For example, in a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assessment, the boundary might cover Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from energy use), and Scope 3 (upstream and downstream emissions in the value chain).
		
		- The spatial boundaries cover the geographic region(s) relevant for the assessment, including but not limited to a specific site, facility, region, or global operations of a company or project.
		
		- The relevant timeframe may be a single year, the entire lifecycle of a product, or a specific project phase.
		
		- Organizational boundaries may include a parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or specific divisions based on control, ownership, or influence.
		
		- Impact may include carbon emissions, energy use, water consumption, biodiversity impact, and waste generation.
		
		- Lifecycle boundaries may cover product or process evaluations (e.g., Life Cycle Assessment or LCA). If so, the boundary defines which stages of the lifecycle are included: Cradle-to-Grave: Includes all stages, from raw material extraction to disposal, Cradle-to-Gate: Covers stages up to the point where the product leaves the manufacturing facility. or Gate-to-Gate: Focuses on a specific segment of the lifecycle, such as manufacturing processes, for example.
		
		- Small, immaterial emissions sources might be excluded if their impact is negligible.
		
		- Stakeholder boundaries with respect to a given sustainability evaluation might include impacts on local communities or supply chain partners.""".

Where funds are to be used, in whole or part, for refinancing, it is recommended that borrowers provide an estimate of the share of financing versus refinancing. Where appropriate, they should also clarify which investments or project portfolios may be refinanced, and, to the extent relevant, the expected look-back period for refinanced Green Projects. A green loan may take the form of one or more tranches of a loan facility. In such cases, the green tranche(s) must be clearly designated, with proceeds of the green tranche(s) credited to a separate account or tracked by the borrower in an appropriate manner. 
		
		The GLP explicitly recognise several broad categories of eligibility for Green Projects with the objective of addressing key areas of environmental concern such as climate change, natural resources depletion, loss of biodiversity, and air, water and soil pollution. This non-exhaustive list, set out in Appendix 1, is intended to capture the most usual types of projects supported, and expected to be supported, by the green loan market. However, it is recognised that definitions of green and green projects may vary depending on sector and geography""".
