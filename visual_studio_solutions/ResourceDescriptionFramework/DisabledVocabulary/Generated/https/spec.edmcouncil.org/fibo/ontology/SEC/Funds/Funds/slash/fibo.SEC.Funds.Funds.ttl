This type of fund must meet two requirements: (1) its primary business is investing in real estate, rather than securities (e.g., stock) issued by other companies; and (2) real estate and other non-securities assets must comprise at least 60% of the fund's assets. The DCIF structure is intentionally calibrated to circumvent classification as an investment company - which would trigger certain SEC registration and disclosure requirements. Under the ICA, if a fund is 'primarily engaged in ... investing ... in securities,' it must register as an investment company. By meeting the 60/40 real estate-to-business allocation, the DCIF qualifies instead as a real estate fund, avoiding that designation."@en.

These funds are typically illiquid, with long investment horizons (5–10 years). They generally provide higher returns than traditional fixed-income instruments, but with greater risk due to borrower default potential. Nonprofit funds may provide lower returns because of the mission to provide affordable funding to disadvantaged borrowers. Key features of private credit funds include:

- Returns come primarily from interest income and potential capital appreciation
- Often involve direct negotiations and customized loan terms."""@en.
